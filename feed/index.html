										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 13, 2020, the Washington Post business pages had a headline that read “The toilet paper shortage is real. But it should be brief.” And sure enough, you can now buy toilet paper without any problems. But it is November, and you still can’t get a date to get a hog or beef processed. Why is that? By the end of the week following the publication of the above headline, the phone starting ringing at T&amp;E, and literally did not stop ringing for months. At times we gave up answering: “Let it go to voice mail,” we muttered to each other. The first few days, it was farmers cancelling dates for processing, reflecting the overnight collapse of their restaurant accounts. Within a few days, they were calling back to book in double what they had just cancelled. One farm that normally harvested 2 to 3 beef a month, most of which was sold to restaurants, suddenly sold 92 quarters as locker beef in that initial crazy 6 weeks. That’s 23 whole beeves for those of you who are math challenged. Demand was so overwhelming that in late April T&amp;E literally stopped scheduling slaughter for the entire month of May, so that we could save our sanity and catch up. By late September, T&amp;E was essentially booked up through the end of 2021—16 months out. It could have been further, but I refuse to schedule into 2022 this far out. Too much uncertainty.</p>
<p>Checking with small processors I know around the country, this is practically a universal story. Consumer habits are clearly being changed by COVID. Will it last? At first, I was dubious: “It’s a flash in the pan. It will all blow over as soon as the big plants get their act together.” Now, I am not so sure. I have heard too many stories of how many chest freezers have been sold, and I have seen too many new connections being made between households and local producers. And the phone keeps ringing. T&amp;E’s current list of unscheduled beef and hogs is about two pages long, and we keep trying to find a way to do more, fit in one more beef. T&amp;E has purchased a new $40,000 stuffer and a new $12,000 vacuum sealer, hired more people, re- organized production layouts. But we can only squeeze so much more production from this old building.</p>
<p>I know a lot of farmers have animals ready for processing, but can’t get a date. I feel your pain. If this trend is to be sustainable, we are going to have to find a way to rebuild old locker plants and build some new small plants. But that is an expensive proposition. It will call for leadership not just from small processors, but from Extension agents, VDACS, elected officials, Virginia Tech, Farm Bureau, and other business and institutional players in Virginia’s ag economy. Right now, that isn’t happening. I am urging every farmer I speak with who can’t get a processing date to call their elected officials—their local Senator and Delegate to Richmond—and let them know what is happening. This is becoming a real crisis. Recently, I have been told more often than I like that someone is getting out of the business of direct marketing meat from livestock they have raised—even though 2020 was the best year they have ever had—because they can’t find adequate processing in 2021. And that’s a damn shame. But at least they can get all the toilet paper they need!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>T&amp;E Meats is now offering processing services for creating certain smoked meat products &#8211; specifically, ham and bacon.  We do a traditional cure using “pink salt” (sodium nitrite), and we also cure products using celery powder as a source of nitrite, which are then labelled “Uncured” Bacon or “Uncured” Ham, for obscure regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>The following products are available: pork bellies as Smoked Slab Bacon or Smoked Sliced Bacon; boneless pork loins as Smoked Canadian Bacon, and boneless hams as Smoked Ham.  The hams can be halved or quartered, but not sliced into deli-style lunch meats.  When bellies are processed as sliced bacon, a certain amount of product will also be labelled as “Bacon Ends &amp; Pieces”.</p>
<p><a href="https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bacon-in-house-2-e1554477766423.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-827 alignleft" src="https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bacon-in-house-2-e1554477766423.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="492" /></a><a href="https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Image-Ham.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-831 alignright" src="https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Image-Ham.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="373" srcset="https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Image-Ham.jpg 326w, https://temeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Image-Ham-222x300.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a></p>
<p>Traditional curing costs $2.50/lb. and “uncured” products using celery powder cost $3.25/lb. Charge is based on “Green Weight” of meat prior to curing &amp; smoking.  There is a $.50 discount for whole slab bacon sides.</p>
<p>As of this date (April 5, 2019) T&amp;E offers only these products.  We will continue to develop product recipes, and anticipate offering processing services for additional products in the future.  Please note that products such as snack sticks, hot dogs, bologna, smoked sausage, etc. are considered “Ready to Eat”, or <strong>RTE</strong>, products, and to produce those products under inspection involves mandatory listeria testing and additional inspection staff scrutiny, which involve additional costs and time.  Our current bacon and ham offerings are considered “Ready to Cook”, not <strong>RTE</strong>, which is one reason we do not offer sliced ham as a deli-style meat (please do not ask for this).</p>
<p>We will alert our customers as we have additional products available in the future.  Please note – as of now, we assume that we will be offering these newer products initially as Locker, “Not for Sale” items while we fine-tune our processes, as these do not involve additional inspection requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Piedmont Environmental Council is looking for individuals who raise or sell beef in Charlottesville, Albemarle, Nelson, Fluvanna, Louisa, Greene, Orange, Madison, Culpeper, Fauquier, Rappahannock and Loudoun County to take their short survey.</p>
<p>PEC is working with Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), a regional non-profit that encourages large institutions like hospitals and universities to purchase locally-raised beef. The purpose of our study is to better understand beef production in the Piedmont and producers&#8217; interest in connecting with a consistent wholesale market. To complement PEC&#8217;s supply study, HCWH is doing a market demand study focused on hospitals and universities in our region. In the long-run, your responses could directly benefit your farm as well as the overall the economic viability of the beef production throughout the Piedmont region.</p>
<p>In order to gather information about the beef economy in the Piedmont, PEC has put together a short survey. If you raise or sell beef, please consider taking 10 minutes to take our survey at <a href="https://619roofing.com/"style="border: none; color: #5a544b; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">619roofing.com</a>!</p>
<p>Take the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScibST-7EmAb1BxFkQkcsn5VN-k9e0qPhIh2J_P_TULp-fhYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">HERE</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January 10, 2018 &#8211; It has come to our attention that inspected slaughter and processing has been temporarily disrupted at Allegheny Meats. We wish them well in quickly overcoming their current obstacles. We are all part of the Virginia farming community, and understand that this may cause some temporary but serious inconvenience for local farmers who have processing scheduled. We are not looking to profit from others misfortune, but we do have some capacity to assist farmers needing immediate processing services. Feel free to contact us. Having said that, we do hope Allegheny is up and running as normal in very near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We always knew that some day, as our success continued, as has that of our customers, that we would be forced to endure the torturous ritual know as a 3rd Party Audit. Those of you in the commercial food world know what this means, and why we might be just a teeeeeny bit worried about it, not really knowing what to expect or how to prepare. Well, that day arrived on June 20th, when the auditor from FSNS appeared as scheduled and spent the day with us. This was a GMP Audit, for Good Manufacturing Practices, and focused on all of our procedures, safety controls, and record-keeping practices. </p>
<p>The audit really looks at how we take a disciplined and structured approach to cleaning, sanitation, training, maintenance, shipping and receiving, and so forth. Well, we heard last week that we passed! Yeah! We hope that in the future this will open some doors for our customers to make some more sales. The <a href="https://www.chimeramotors.com/upholstery" style="border: none; color: #444; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">chimera motors</a> and more of the larger retail and institutional customers will not buy unless the product has been processed in a plant that has an outside food safety auditor. USDA inspection alone is often no longer enough.</p>
