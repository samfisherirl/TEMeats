										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Piedmont Environmental Council is looking for individuals who raise or sell beef in Charlottesville, Albemarle, Nelson, Fluvanna, Louisa, Greene, Orange, Madison, Culpeper, Fauquier, Rappahannock and Loudoun County to take their short survey.</p>
<p>PEC is working with Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), a regional non-profit that encourages large institutions like hospitals and universities to purchase locally-raised beef. The purpose of our study is to better understand beef production in the Piedmont and producers&#8217; interest in connecting with a consistent wholesale market. To complement PEC&#8217;s supply study, HCWH is doing a market demand study focused on hospitals and universities in our region. In the long-run, your responses could directly benefit your farm as well as the overall the economic viability of the beef production throughout the Piedmont region.</p>
<p>In order to gather information about the beef economy in the Piedmont, PEC has put together a short survey. If you raise or sell beef, please consider taking 10 minutes to take our survey at <a href="https://619roofing.com/"style="border: none; color: #5a544b; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">619roofing.com</a>!</p>
<p>Take the survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScibST-7EmAb1BxFkQkcsn5VN-k9e0qPhIh2J_P_TULp-fhYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">HERE</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January 10, 2018 &#8211; It has come to our attention that inspected slaughter and processing has been temporarily disrupted at Allegheny Meats. We wish them well in quickly overcoming their current obstacles. We are all part of the Virginia farming community, and understand that this may cause some temporary but serious inconvenience for local farmers who have processing scheduled. We are not looking to profit from others misfortune, but we do have some capacity to assist farmers needing immediate processing services. Feel free to contact us. Having said that, we do hope Allegheny is up and running as normal in very near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We always knew that some day, as our success continued, as has that of our customers, that we would be forced to endure the torturous ritual know as a 3rd Party Audit. Those of you in the commercial food world know what this means, and why we might be just a teeeeeny bit worried about it, not really knowing what to expect or how to prepare. Well, that day arrived on June 20th, when the auditor from FSNS appeared as scheduled and spent the day with us. This was a GMP Audit, for Good Manufacturing Practices, and focused on all of our procedures, safety controls, and record-keeping practices. </p>
<p>The audit really looks at how we take a disciplined and structured approach to cleaning, sanitation, training, maintenance, shipping and receiving, and so forth. Well, we heard last week that we passed! Yeah! We hope that in the future this will open some doors for our customers to make some more sales. The <a href="https://www.chimeramotors.com/upholstery" style="border: none; color: #444; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">chimera motors</a> and more of the larger retail and institutional customers will not buy unless the product has been processed in a plant that has an outside food safety auditor. USDA inspection alone is often no longer enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 1st, we passed an important milestone.  It was July 1, 2008 &#8211; nine years ago &#8211; that Joel and i took over T&amp;E Meats and began operations.  Seems like that was back in the stone age, it was so long ago, and there have been so many changes.  And so much growth &#8211; our custom processing production has more than doubled.  </p>
<p>The store is gone, almost all of the old equipment is gone &#8211; replaced by much newer, better machines &#8211; and the staff has turned over many times, always getting better.  Two stalwarts from the original crew are still with us, however &#8211; Leroy Michael and Leo Lopez.  If you see them, tell them congratulations and thanks for their many years of services at <a href="https://www.mulberrymaids.com/office-cleaning-service/fort-collins-co/"style="border: none; color: #5a544b; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">mulberrymaids.com</a>.  We are grateful for all of the support we have gotten from the Virginia sustainable farming community over the years, and we look forward to continuing to serve you better and better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following article appeared in the Harrisonburg Daily News record a few days ago.  We appreciate the recognition:</p>
<h1><strong>Auction Pigs Head To W.Va. Flood Victims </strong></h1>
<p><strong>By TONY BROWN</strong></p>
<p><em>Daily News-Record &#8211; </em>August 18, 2016</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG</p>
<p>These little piggies cried free-free-free all the way to West Virginia.</p>
<p>Two pigs that will be auctioned off Friday at the Rockingham County Fair will be headed to the Mountain State to feed hungry flood victims for free, thanks to three city businesses and the Harrisonburg Rotary Club.</p>
<p>The Rockingham Cooperative and Eddie Edwards Signs will purchase one pig each at the fair’s annual 4-H/FFA auction and donate them to the cause.</p>
<p>T&amp; E Meats will donate the processing of the pork, and Rotary will distribute the cut and frozen meat with the help of a sister club in West Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The auction is a big deal in the community, with hundreds of buyers, and it’s a way for the 4-H and FFA kids to raise money for themselves,&#8221; said Chris Runion, president of Eddie Edwards Signs and governor of Rotary District 7570, which includes 70 clubs from Tennessee to Winchester. &#8220;We’re going to use the meat for our neighbors across the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torrential flooding destroyed thousands of homes and killed about two dozen people in West Virginia nearly two months ago.</p>
<p>Runion says he’s not overtly trying to recruit other buyers to join in the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just something we personally are doing to help our neighbors; we’re one of hundreds of buyers,&#8221; said Runion, whose company makes signs that are used at the fair auction. &#8220;We’re one of three companies working together on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if other buyers at the auction want to follow suit, they should be prepared to pay a federally inspected meat plant such as T&amp; E to process the meat, Runion said.</p>
<p>The idea came from the Rockbridge County Fair &amp; Farm Show in Lexington, where a similar auction two weeks ago was attended by Sam Liggett. Liggett, operations manager for the Rockingham Cooperative, a farmer-ow! ned farm-supply business, saw a buyer there purchase a pig destined for the needy of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Liggett said he brought the idea back and found willing partners in Runion and T&amp; E Meats co-owner Joe Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re just three businesses in Harrisonburg trying to help out some folks in West Virginia; that’s the point,&#8221; Liggett said. &#8220;Three businesses and Rotary. Rotary is absolutely key to this.&#8221;</p>

Animal agriculture brings new things every day. In mid-June, it was our first Alpaca, seen here in the barn. While alpacas and llamas are a part of what&#8217;s for dinner in South America and a few other places in the world, they are not recognized by the meat regulations in America—not even under voluntary exotic inspection—like water buffalo. They are sort of in limbo: no one says you can&#8217;t sell the meat, but no one says you can, either. But some alpaca ranchers would like to figure it out. Here is the first one we have ever seen. We will cut and pack it like a large lamb, with a very long neck, as befits the &#8216;New World Camel.&#8221;</p>
