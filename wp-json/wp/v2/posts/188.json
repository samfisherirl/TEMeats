Did I mention I like animals?\u00a0 I like being surrounded by them, all kinds of them.\u00a0 I enjoy sharing their lives, in all ways.\u00a0 I enjoy nourishing them, and letting them nourish me.\u00a0 I am glad that I can eat whole foods, knowing the life they lived in life, and sharing their body in death.\u00a0 There is a richness and variety here that is unsurpassed.\u00a0 I am glad I do not have to take pills to make up for \u00a0impoverished food, that I do not have to spend my evenings trying to figure out what nutrient I am missing and how to compensate for it.\u00a0 That is just one carnivore&#8217;s take on life.\u00a0 I have no problem with vegetarians or vegans.\u00a0 It\u2019s their life, their choice.\u00a0 But I love my life, and my choice.\u00a0 I think it rich beyond compare. I sometimes wonder the degree to which Disney can be seen as a seminal figure in the development of veganism, with his vision of animals as sentimental cartoons.\u00a0 I am sure this vision influences many young people, who make choices based on inexperience and emotionality.\u00a0 Animals aren&#8217;t cartoons, they are real, with a real place in the scheme of things.\u00a0 However, it also occurs to me that veganism is a natural response to the fear young people feel looking at the future, and at ongoing environmental degradation, the sense that something vital is being damaged beyond repair, and they have to do something to fix it.\u00a0 In that sense, veganism appears to be an entirely rational, as opposed to emotional, choice.\u00a0 It does make me sad, because I like animals.\u00a0 And I see young people making these choices to save the natural world that mean that animals have no place in their world. At least, not in the same way that these wonderful creatures are in my world.\u00a0 Not in the urban world which I observe to be the common habitat of the wild vegan.\u00a0 That, it seems to me, is part of the backdrop of this kaleidoscopic modern conversation around meat and ethics, which is growing more heated.\u00a0 One of the strange dilemmas of a warming world of 7 billion heading toward 9.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was recently reading the comments to an on-line article about the ethics of meat-eating.\u00a0 What follows is my response to the comment \u201cWhat we need are place-based, not plant-based, diets.\u201d\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t have said it better, and so I wrote: &#8220;I eat animals because I like them.\u00a0 I like their meat, and I like [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/188"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/19"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=188"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/188\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":189,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/188\/revisions\/189"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=188"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=188"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=188"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
