When the Local Food movement really succeeds, we\u2019ll be mirroring the days when our grandparents used every \u201ceverything but the squeal\u201d.\u00a0There are some major hurtles to leap before we get there, and there are some encouraging signs that we just might be able to succeed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-171 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/blog_image.png\" alt=\"blog_image\" width=\"308\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/blog_image.png 308w, https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/blog_image-200x300.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" \/>Small abattoirs are under tremendous economic pressure.\u00a0 In recent memory rendering plants paid us for fat and bones and blood and entrails, all of which are used to create an enormous variety of products including cosmetics, minerals, and animal feed. Now we pay the rendering plants every time they pick up the parts of the animals that we can\u2019t sell directly, as if they were just like any other waste disposal service, even though we are supplying them with usable materials.\u00a0 The most painful change is the cowhides.\u00a0 Where the rendering plants paid as much as $65 a hide a few short years ago, we now get just $3 a hide!\u00a0 Part of it is the economic downturn, but the bigger factor is that consolidation and vertical integration in the meat processing industry have motivated the big plants to construct their own rendering plants.\u00a0 Consequently, the few companies that dominate the industry can control the market in hides and waste products, and there is little room for the raw materials that small abbatoirs produce.\u00a0 We used to be able to offset a significant part of our labor costs with the income from rendering plants, but those days are over.\u00a0 This is part of the sad story that is destroying community-based slaughterhouses all across America.<\/p>\n<p>So we need to get creative.\u00a0 I recently got a phone call made me laugh.\u00a0 A man\u2019s voice on the other end asked \u201cIs this Joe?\u201d After I replied in the affirmative, he quickly said \u201cI have a question for you, but PLEASE, PLEASE don\u2019t hang up.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a joke, I am very serious.\u201d I assured him I would not hang up.\u00a0 He took a deep breath and asked, \u201cDo you have any bull penises?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I laughed out loud, but immediately told him I understood what he was looking for, and yes, I could help him out.\u00a0 A bit more conversation let me know I was talking to Chris Haney in Richmond, VA of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.puredogtreats.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pure Dog Treats<\/a>, and we have now begun doing a little business together in not only bull penises but also beef hearts for his pet treat business.\u00a0 All male beeves, bull or steer, have a long thick cord that goes from their kidneys to the scrotum then down to their belly that performs both sexual and urinary functions.\u00a0 This can be dried and prepared into a dog chew toy called a \u201cbully stick.\u201d\u00a0 Before I started to do business with Chris, this tasty tidbit typically went into the barrel with the rest of the offal for pickup by the rendering plant, but from now on, they\u2019ll be going into the freezer.\u00a0 Chris told me that he had wanted to make bully sticks for a while, but the only source of raw material he could find was from Argentina, and he didn\u2019t feel good about using it.<\/p>\n<p>I love that Chris will pay me a fair price for the animal parts that I used to have to pay to dispose, and that he\u2019s turning these raw materials into something useful and desirable.\u00a0 It\u2019s a perfect example of a basic sustainable manufacturing principle in action:\u00a0 One industry\u2019s waste becomes another\u2019s raw material, and everyone makes out in the deal.<\/p>\n<p>Locally-produced, sustainable pet food products are direct-to-consumer items, and supplying producers with raw materials can create a dollar return to local slaughterhouses, which small<\/p>\n<p>plants like T&amp;E need.\u00a0 We not only work with Chris, but also with another start-up run by Adam Beslove, who creates Wolfie\u2019s Dog Food\u00a0in a small facility in neighboring Augusta County.\u00a0 One of his principal ingredients is green tripe, which is basically the washed out fresh stomach of a cow or steer.\u00a0 He picks up barrels of bellies from our kill floor every other Wednesday when we harvest Joel Salatin\u2019s Polyface Farm beef.\u00a0 The stomachs immediately get hauled back to his manufacturing facility where they\u2019re washed, mixed with other ingredients, and ground into a raw frozen dog food that Fido cannot get enough of.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to supplying raw materials for Pure Dog Treats and Wolfie\u2019s Dog Food, we also run special lamb slaughter days for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chownowpetfood.com)\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">Chow Now<\/a>,\u00a0which produces raw frozen pet foods. We slaughter the lamb for a product that combines ground lamb bone, offal, and meat as well as organic vegetables into a high quality product designed as complete meal containing all of the necessary vitamins, minerals, and calories, without allergens like wheat and corn.\u00a0 Like Adam, Chow Now\u2019s founder Carole King is passionate about providing the highest quality pure pet food, and they\u2019re committed to sourcing lamb, chicken, turkey, and other meats, as well as organic vegetables, directly from Virginia\u2019s family farmers.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, the local sustainable meat industry is not just about satisfying human cravings for high quality, humanely raised meats. There is also a local pet food revolution going on in these parts, and we enjoy being a true and essential player in that arena. And needless to say, we also enjoy the mutual economic benefits that flow out of the process to everyone involved.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In her 2008 book, The Compassionate Carnivore,\u00a0Catherine Friend makes a rough estimate that America throws away 7,500 cattle, 18,000 hogs, and 1 million chickens a day.\u00a0 Every day.
