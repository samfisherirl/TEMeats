The skull is what remained of a small group of Scottish Highland cattle that passed through the T&amp;E plant.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/blog_image_cows.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-174 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/blog_image_cows-300x201.png\" alt=\"blog_image_cows\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/blog_image_cows-300x201.png 300w, https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/blog_image_cows-450x301.png 450w, https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/blog_image_cows.png 622w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>A few weeks ago we had two of the most unusual animals I have ever seen in our barn.\u00a0 The owner had called to say that he had a couple of mature Texas Longhorns and asked if we\u2019d be able to process them. \u201cSure, bring \u2018em in\u201c was our reply.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t at T&amp;E when they arrived, but I was definitely impressed when I finally saw them.<\/p>\n<p>Most cattle have prosaic numbered ear tags, but the tags on these animals set them\u2014and their owner&#8211;apart. They had names, not numbers.\u00a0 The black and white female was \u201cQueen of Spades,\u201d and the magnificent yellow-brown bull was \u201cGingerbread Boogie.\u201d His horns were an amazing 62\u201d from end to end.\u00a0 And don\u2019t think for a minute that he doesn\u2019t know where those tips are.\u00a0 When I first went out to see him, he walked up to the door of the pen.\u00a0 I had heard that he was tame, so I put my hand through boards, thinking he might want his chin scratched. Well! He jumped back with a snort, glared at me, then very deliberately and slowly swung his head, bringing the left horn tip to where my hand had been. \u201cBam!\u201d He slammed the tip against the stall door with impressive power.\u00a0 He deliberately brought the right horn tip around and repeated his action, then stared at me as if to say, \u201cNow we understand each other, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u00a0 Yes, sir we do!<\/p>\n<p>Queen of Spades lifted her tail and had a little pee.\u00a0 I watched as Gingerbread Boogie tasted her urine, sticking his tongue in the stream, then curling his lips back and inhaling deeply to catch the fine aromas, like a wine aficionado with a premier cru Burgundy.\u00a0 Bulls do this to see if the cow is coming into heat.\u00a0 Here he was in the abbatoir, and he was enthusiastically thinking of one last fling.\u00a0 I admired his spirit.<\/p>\n<p>We ran the kill floor the following day when I was away at a meeting. I called in for a progress report, and my staff reported that things hadn\u2019t gone well.\u00a0 Gingerbread Boogie\u2019s horns were too long to make it up the lane into the knock box, so they had called his owner to come take them back home.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say I was sorry to hear that they were back on pasture.\u00a0 We have work to do, but we admire the animals and their beauty too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the more fascinating things about working as meat processor to a large variety of small farmers is experiencing the diversity of their livestock.\u00a0 I never quite know what to expect from day to day.\u00a0 On New Years\u2019 Eve alone we had heritage Gulf Coast and Highland Cheviot sheep; Berkshire, Duroc, and Tamworth hogs; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":174,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/164"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/19"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=164"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/164\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":563,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/164\/revisions\/563"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/174"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=164"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=164"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/temeats.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=164"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
