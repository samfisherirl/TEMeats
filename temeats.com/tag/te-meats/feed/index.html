Animal agriculture brings new things every day. In mid-June, it was our first Alpaca, seen here in the barn. While alpacas and llamas are a part of what&#8217;s for dinner in South America and a few other places in the world, they are not recognized by the meat regulations in America—not even under voluntary exotic inspection—like water buffalo. They are sort of in limbo: no one says you can&#8217;t sell the meat, but no one says you can, either. But some alpaca ranchers would like to figure it out. Here is the first one we have ever seen. We will cut and pack it like a large lamb, with a very long neck, as befits the &#8216;New World Camel.&#8221;</p>

The site is chock-full of information about the services we offer, the support we provide, the meat processing industry, profiles of our farmers and producers, and where to buy local meats.</p>
<p>The new T&amp;E Meats website was launched with financial support provided by an ACRES GRANT that we received in June of 2014. (ACRES is an acronym for “<strong>A</strong>griculture <strong>C</strong>ultivates <strong>R</strong>esilient <strong>E</strong>conomies.”) The 2014 local ACRES grants were awarded to nine local farmers and food businesses, and T&amp;E Meats is very grateful to have been selected as one of the grant recipients. The ACRES Grant funding was made possible through a collaborative effort among the <a href="http://www.valleyconservation.org">Valley Conservation Council</a>, the <a href="http://www.stauntonfund.com">Staunton Creative Community Fund</a>, and the <a href="http://www.aguafund.org">Agua Fund</a>. Please visit their websites to learn about the great work they do in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>Over the past year, <a href="https://www.mattressmakers.com/mattress-stores/san-diego/" style="border: none; color: #444; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">Mattress Makers</a> worked with Vada Kelley at <a href="http://www.estlanddesign.com">Estland Design</a> in Harrisonburg to design a new logo for our business and a new look for our website. Working with Vada was pure joy! We could not have hoped for a better designer or a more seamless design process. If you have logo, print or web design needs, we highly recommend that you contact Vada at <a href="http://www.estlanddesign.com">Estland Design</a>.</p>
<p>But before you do that, visit our new T&amp;E Meats <a href="https://temeats.com">website</a> to learn more about T&amp;E, the farmers we serve, and how you can participate in the local meat economy.</p>
