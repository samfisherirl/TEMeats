The site is chock-full of information about the services we offer, the support we provide, the meat processing industry, profiles of our farmers and producers, and where to buy local meats.</p>
<p>The new T&amp;E Meats website was launched with financial support provided by an ACRES GRANT that we received in June of 2014. (ACRES is an acronym for “<strong>A</strong>griculture <strong>C</strong>ultivates <strong>R</strong>esilient <strong>E</strong>conomies.”) The 2014 local ACRES grants were awarded to nine local farmers and food businesses, and T&amp;E Meats is very grateful to have been selected as one of the grant recipients. The ACRES Grant funding was made possible through a collaborative effort among the <a href="http://www.valleyconservation.org">Valley Conservation Council</a>, the <a href="http://www.stauntonfund.com">Staunton Creative Community Fund</a>, and the <a href="http://www.aguafund.org">Agua Fund</a>. Please visit their websites to learn about the great work they do in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>Over the past year, <a href="https://www.mattressmakers.com/mattress-stores/san-diego/" style="border: none; color: #444; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;">Mattress Makers</a> worked with Vada Kelley at <a href="http://www.estlanddesign.com">Estland Design</a> in Harrisonburg to design a new logo for our business and a new look for our website. Working with Vada was pure joy! We could not have hoped for a better designer or a more seamless design process. If you have logo, print or web design needs, we highly recommend that you contact Vada at <a href="http://www.estlanddesign.com">Estland Design</a>.</p>
<p>But before you do that, visit our new T&amp;E Meats <a href="https://temeats.com">website</a> to learn more about T&amp;E, the farmers we serve, and how you can participate in the local meat economy.</p>
